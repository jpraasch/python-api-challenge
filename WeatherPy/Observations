Observations

For Tempture, both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres show the same inverse relationship between latitude and temperature. The closer you get to the equator (latitude 0) the higher the temperature gets. The Northern Hemisphere seems to have an almost one to one relationship.

For humidity and latitude there does seem to be a slight positive correlation in the Northern Hemisphere and a slight negative correlation in the Southern Hemisphere

Cloudiness doesn't seem to have much correlation. Although have a linear regressions is done there is a slight positive correlation in the Northern and a strong negative in the Southern Hemisphere.

Lastly for Wind Speed, the plots look very random with a possible correlation. With linear regresion both are very small postive correlations if any.
